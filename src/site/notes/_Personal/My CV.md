# **Cuneyd Kahraman**
**Game Programming & DevOps**

### About Me
I'm a generalist programmer capable of writing gameplay, systems, tooling and pipeline code, as well as managing DevOps for larger teams. Prior to working at a studio I had been a hobbyist game developer for around 10 years and have a working understanding of most areas of game development.

### Experience
**Lunaboot Studios: Graviton (UE5/Unity)**
Contributions:
- Co-developed a custom gravity system for a first person puzzle game in UE5, allowing for omnidirectional gravity calculations. The system is multithreaded and spatially partitioned using an octree, I am currently in the process of migrating functionality onto the GPU and generating lookup tables to allow for recalculating gravity in real-time. **I talked about the [[Talks and Workshops/Gravitons Universal Gravity System Slides\|development of the gravity system of Graviton]] at the Unreal Meetup at the Epic Games offices in London.**
- Deployed a bare metal Perforce Helix Core SCM on an Ubuntu server, allowing for cheaper project storage scaling. The server and any docker services/utilities are accessible via a VPN or SSH tunnel. I've setup uptime monitoring to improve SLI tracking and avoid resource saturation.
- Have written extensive documentation for setting up and integrating Perforce Helix Core into Unreal Engine and build scripts (in PowerShell) for automating rebuilding the game and custom UE5 engine fork.
- Worked on the Unity prototype of the game, including the development of an in-game level editor.

**Peak Cyber Institute: Programming Intern (Unity)**
Contributions: Created an android quiz game for a cyber security training company and launched it on Google Play Store.

**CME Group: Programming Intern**
Contributions: Got mentorship in a range of topics including cyber security, networking, service applications, unit testing and general software development best practices.

**Shards of Bone (Personal Project): Sole Programmer (Unity)**
Contributions: First person parkour controller with grappling mechanics, boid based enemy movement and custom camera controller.

**Nomad Stays: Director**
Contributions: Setup all the infrastructure and automations for the business, channel management, price/availability adjustment, automated messaging and a direct booking website.
