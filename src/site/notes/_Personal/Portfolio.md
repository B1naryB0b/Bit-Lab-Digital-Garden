**Contributions:**
- Worked on the Unity prototype of the game including a level editor
- Hosted Perforce Helix Core SCM on an Ubuntu server (+UE5 integration)
- Managed build pipeline and distribution for custom UE5 engine fork
- Co-developed the rotator system for gravity manipulation in Unity/UE5
- Wrote documentation and onboarding guides for non-programmers
- Setup alerting and remote monitoring for our Perforce server

**I talked about the [[Talks and Workshops/Gravitons Universal Gravity System Slides\|development of the gravity system of Graviton]] at the Unreal Meetup at the Epic Games offices in London**

##### Shards of Bone
**Solo Dev**
**Tools: Unity/Git/Plastic SCM**

- Scriptable object config system
- Enemy boid system with compute shader (based on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/SebLague/Boids))
- Wave management with easy to use editor tooling
- Simple IK and recoil system (using [these customisable low-poly arms](https://hozq3d.gumroad.com/l/LVA4?layout=profile))
- Advanced camera with tilting, shake, dynamic FOV and speed lines
- Highly extendable multi-attack mode shooting system
- Custom shaders for barrier walls and Sobel filtering
- Everything else

**This project is heavily inspired by one of my favourite arcade FPS games [Devil Daggers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/422970/Devil_Daggers/)**

##### Water Shader Workshop
**KCL Workshop**
**Tools: Godot/Git**
**GitHub:** https://github.com/B1naryB0b/Godot-Water-Shader-Workshop

I ran a workshop at King's College London around the basics of vertex and fragment shaders. By the end of the session students were able to reproduce the shader below.
