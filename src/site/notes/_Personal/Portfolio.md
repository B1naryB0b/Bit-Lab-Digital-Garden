- Enemy boid system with compute shader (based on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/SebLague/Boids))
- Wave management with easy to use editor tooling
- Simple IK and recoil system (using [these customisable low-poly arms](https://hozq3d.gumroad.com/l/LVA4?layout=profile))

- Highly extendable multi-attack mode shooting system
- Custom shaders for barrier walls and Sobel filtering
- Everything else

**This project is heavily inspired by one of my favourite arcade FPS games [Devil Daggers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/422970/Devil_Daggers/)**

##### Water Shader Workshop
**KCL Workshop**
**Tools: Godot/Git**

I ran a workshop at King's College London around the basics of vertex and fragment shaders. By the end of the session students were able to reproduce the shader below.
