Making connections is actually relatively easy (compared to making a game), it just requires some practice and a certain mindset. Everyone sucks at it when they start, the key is to suck less the more you do it.

This guide is for networking at [[Career Development/Networking/Games Events\|games events]]:

1. **Don't go into a conversation with the intent to get hired**, well you *can*, but it turns that relationship into a transactional rather than reciprocal one.
2. **Ask questions**, people love to talk about their work, who they are and what they do. Ask how they made a shader in a game or how they got such polished movement. Even better, **if you can play their game and give feedback, do it.**
3. **Try to have a positive interaction**, you want people to have a positive image of you the next time you meet. Don't engage in politics or start an argument, although debating a topic is fine (within reason).
4. **Get a method of contacting them**, you can also introduce yourself if you haven't already. **Make sure that you have some kind of contact you can readily give**, ideally you want multiple. Ask for more casual communication channels first (Discord) if possible, before more professional ones (LinkedIn). Although if people redirect you to a more formal channel, then follow their lead.
5. **Follow up after the event.** Send a message on the communication channel reminding them of who you were (forgetting someone is no big deal) and try to setup another time you can meet and do something e.g. if they are going to another event, or want playtesting, or want to hang out etc.
6. **Congratulations! You have done a networking! New connection unlocked!**


Bonus Tips:
- **Avoid spending all your time with the same person.** It's tempting to talk to the same person for the entire event once you've acclimatised to them. Avoid this, try to set a maximum limit to how long you speak to someone, try to naturally break off the conversation so you can make even more connections.
- **Have a QR code with your contact details at the ready.** This will make giving people your info much smoother and reduce the time spent faffing around trying to find your details. One of the best ways to do this is to either replace your lock screen wallpaper with it, or get a widget that can display it on your home screen.
