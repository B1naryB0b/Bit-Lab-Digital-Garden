# Hi, welcome to Bit Lab!

**This is a vault of information on anything game dev.** I'm hoping to make this the birth place of a community focused on bringing together the vast amounts of game development resources onto a single, easy to navigate, easy to understand, website.

There is lots of gold out there for those that know where to look, but it is often a long and tedious journey to find all of those pockets of gold scattered all over the internet. **From GDC, Brackeys, Code Monkey, Unreal Sensei and many, many more.**

*Please note this site is WIP and might change a lot especially in these early stages*

# Where to start?

If you are unsure, **check out the [[Bit Hubs/Nooblets Guide\|Nooblets Guide]] for an idea of what to do.** It contains links to many of the most useful info for budding new developers. Otherwise, just poking around in the sidebar or the graph view is also a great place to start.

# Looking for something specific?

Use the **search function in the sidebar/header (shortcut is CTRL + K)** and type in what you are looking for, if you are luck it might already be inside the Bit Lab. If what you are searching for is a bit more wishy-washy **try using the [[Bit Hubs/Tags\|tags]] to find what you are looking for. At the very least it will narrow your search.**

# Looking for updates on my games?

**Check out the devlog section** for any updates on the games I'm currently working on. I'll put any content related to my work up here for those interested.

# Want to help?

The easiest way to help is to buy something, donate or get a membership to support **Bit Lab:** <script type='text/javascript' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support Me on Ko-fi', '#29abe0', 'R5R4UB7TL');kofiwidget2.draw();</script>
<script src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/scripts/overlay-widget.js'></script>
<script>
  kofiWidgetOverlay.draw('bitlab', {
    'type': 'floating-chat',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.text': 'Support me',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.background-color': '#00b9fe',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.text-color': '#fff'
  });
</script>

I (and anyone willing to join me on my torturous quest) will try to cover a range of topics in game development and adjacent fields. I would be more than **open to contributions from individuals from any part of the game dev community**, be it Gameplay Testers, QA folks, YouTube Dev Loggers, AAA Veterans or even a hobbyist who just likes to join game jams. **Everyone is welcome!**

Any contribution no matter how small, will be recorder in the [[Bit Hubs/Contributors\|contributors]] list.

**If you are interested in helping out directly, [[Bit Hubs/Contact\|contact me]].** 

I am planning to setup a discord around the Bit Lab if there are more users and [[Bit Hubs/Contributors\|contributors]], so you might see a discord link here soon.

# Spot a mistake?

Although I and any contributors do our best to keep the information as high quality as possible, there will inevitably be mistakes in the Bit Lab. If that is the case **please [[Bit Hubs/Contact\|contact me]] and I'll try to quickly resolve and correct any issues** that arise from this.
