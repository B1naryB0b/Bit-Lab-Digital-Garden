# Become a Contributor

## Donating

The easiest way to support Bit Lab is by donating. I also take commissions for topics, so if you'd really like to see a specific topic covered on Bit Lab then send me a request.

<script type='text/javascript' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support Me on Ko-fi', '#29abe0', 'R5R4UB7TL');kofiwidget2.draw();</script> 
<script src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/scripts/overlay-widget.js'></script>
<script>
  kofiWidgetOverlay.draw('bitlab', {
    'type': 'floating-chat',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.text': 'Support me',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.background-color': '#00b9fe',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.text-color': '#fff'
  });
</script>

## Writing

If you have some time to spare, a volunteer to write high quality material for Bit Lab is always welcome. Feel free to [[Bit Hubs/Contact\|contact me]] if you would like to write up a specific topic or want to add to the site regularly.
