# Bit Lab

**This is a vault of information on anything game dev.** I'm hoping to make this the birth place of a community focused on bringing together the vast amounts of game development resources onto a single, easy to navigate, easy to understand, website.

There is lots of gold out there for those that know where to look, but it is often a long and tedious journey to find all of those pockets of gold scattered all over the internet. **From GDC, Brackeys, Code Monkey, Unreal Sensei and many, many more.**

As part of this I am open sourcing the code behind the site in the hopes that it will make more accessible and conducive for building a community.

This site was built using the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden). Although the plugin or Obsidian are not required to host a local version of the site.

## Requirements

**Hardware**
1 CPU or vCPU
2GB RAM
300MB STORAGE

**Software**
Node.js 20.x

## Installation

Once you have cloned the repository onto your machine and changed your terminal/powershell directory to `Bit-Lab-Digital-Garden` you can simply run:
```bash
npm start
```
And the server will run locally at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) by default

To see available build commands use:
```bash
npm run
```
